Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1) Ask questions.
    What are the sizes of the strings?
    Are the strings the same size?
    Case sensitive?
2) String vs string, Caramel vs car, eree
3) Brute force? check each of the characters and see if it's in the other string
4) Optimize
    If ascii, create an array of 128 integers (256 if extended ascii), thousands if unicode?
        each index keeps a count of the number of characters in the list.
    Iterate through both strings, adding for one, subtracting for the other.
    We should end up with 0 for each index in the array.
