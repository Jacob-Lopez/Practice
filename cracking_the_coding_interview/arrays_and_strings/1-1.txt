1) Listen, ask questions
Is this ascii? If it's ascii we could have a small array to store the counts of each character.
    If it's unicode, you should probably just use a hashmap.
2) Example? [a b c d e ... a]
   Example2? same as first but with unicode characters
   Example3? Maybe something too big to fit into memory.
3) Brute force
    //Iterate through the list
        //Do a lookup with array or hashmap
        //if theres nothing for that character in the datastructure,
            //add 1 to the array or hashmap at that location
4) Optimize
    // Maybe you don't need the whole array or hashmap.
    // If it's just ascii characters, could store that in a byte.
        // 0 for that bit in the byte would mean absence, 1 would mean the character exists in the sequence
